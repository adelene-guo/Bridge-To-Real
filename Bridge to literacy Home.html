          <h3> It starts with a seed </h3> 
          <p>Impact starts with passion, and Bridge to Literacy is no exception. As first-generation Americans, National Spelling Bee competitors, and
             champion debaters respectively, co-founders Elizabeth Shvarts and Gary Shteyman are committed to spreading literacy to every child, no 
             matter their financial background or geographic location. Please click on this <a id="about-anchor" href="Our Team.html">link</a> to learn more about our team.</p>
