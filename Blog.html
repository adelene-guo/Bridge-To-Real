      <h2>Patriarchy and Oppressive Feminism in 'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Akshinta Das, January 6, 2023
      <div>
        <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/287f8bee-30b1-4ec7-96da-2b5cac237af5/color-purple-the-1985-004-whoop-goldberg-head-.jpg/:/rs=w:1280" style="width: 100%; padding: 10px;" alt="">
      </div></h5>
      <p>

In the book 'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker, the biggest problem the sisters, Celie and Nettie face is oppression. Continuously raped by a man they call as their father, Celie is married off and is trapped in an ugly marriage. A lot of times her husband abuses her and uses her for sexual favours. She is also separated from her sister Nettie.<br><br>

Quoted by her father, "You better not tell nobody but God it'd kill your mammy." (Walker 11). Since then the book addresses Celie writing letters to God expressing her feelings and helplessness.<br><br>

Alice Walker emphasizes at the beginning of the novel, the severity of female justice, by explaining the consequences of the protagonist Celie being raped and sexually abused. At the beginning of the novel, The Color Purple, Celie is being exacted to physical, verbal as well as sexual abuse.<br><br>

Celie cannot resist the abuse which she faces from her stepfather as well as her husband, and thinks this is natural like the way it should be. Having said that, later in the novel, after the influence of females like Shug, Sophie and Avery, Celie develops confidence which reaches its peak by the end of the novel.<br><br>

Celie is trapped in an ugly marriage. She imagines herself as a tree when she is beaten or sexually abused by Mr. __________. Heaven will last always, as she believes, while life on earth will soon be over. <br><br>

<b>The influence of women</b><br><br>

The confidence that Celie develops all through the novel is attributed to the bond of sisterhood Celie builds with Nettie, Shug and Sophia. The women in the novel come together to support and sustain each other. The bond of sisterhood is important between Nettie and Celie, Sofia and Odessa and metaphorically between Mary Agnes and Sofia, Albert's sister and Celie, Tashi and Olivia and Shug Avery and Celie. The act of empowerment is shown between the women of the novel through emotional teamwork.<br><br>

Shug Avery is a female character who is characterised as the most 'liberated' of the women, even though she is a constant sufferer of obnoxious attacks from the elders of her church due to her lifestyle. Her professional career as a Blues Singer gives her the freedom much more than several women of her age, who are bound by home, work and child care.<br><br>

Celie is an example of the most silenced woman in the novel since there is evidence of her having incorporated within herself being a silenced individual. In the initial introduction of Fonso, Celie's step-father is that of being forceful towards Celie's mother. An act of choking Celie and the first words he says in the text is 'You better shut up..." The men are already being illustrated as violent and forcefully subduing the female figure. Celie's inability to speak proper English can likewise be connected with being hushed in light of the fact that it is through language that individuals can reason with one another. Furthermore, Fonso sexually abuses Celie she gets pregnant and she gives birth to two children who are sold by Fonso without the consent of Celie or her mother. Celie says that God took away her first child but the use of God being the cruel being in this part of the reading just shows that Celie could not do anything about what Fonso did.<br><br>

      <h2>A Tree Grows In Brooklyn</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Angelina Ochoa, January 6, 2023

      </div></h5>
      <p>
      Author Betty Smith ties an intriguing family drama with a historical setting in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Smith tells the story of the Nolan family who resides in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in the 1900s.<br><br>

The characters are notably realistic.  In some literature, characters appear without flaws or shortcomings. However, Smith's characterization of the Nolan Family is the exact opposite. Johnny Nolan is an alcoholic and Katie Nolan is an overwhelmed mother, cautious not to favor one child over another.  These issues' relevance to the modern day, allows readers to sympathize and even relate to the characters' struggles and motivations. <br><br>

For many readers, Francie acts as a guide: throughout the novel, she grows from a young child into a young woman and is subjected to the gender stereotypes brought by her age. <br><br>

While significant steps have been taken against gender inequality, stigmas still exist in the modern world. By highlighting the effect of these stereotypes on Francie, readers better understand injustice and intolerance and how to address them.<br><br>

Although the novel highlights its fair share of character flaws, conflict, and heartbreak, it creates comfort as the characters come of age and move on. The characters progress and overcome, and the reader, as they, finds hope with the promise of happier days.<br><br>

      <h2>WHAT ROLE DOES EDUCATION PLAY IN OUR LIFE?</h2>
      <h5>Real Stories | by: Nazifa Yasar, January 6, 2023</h5>
      <p style="text-align: center;">"Education is the most powerful weapon which may change the world."<br><br>

-Nelson Mandela </p><p><br>

The global literacy rate is 86.3%. Only 8% of people can achieve their goals and become successful. So is education only about scoring excellent academic grades and getting a chance to join a prestigious corporate office with a high pay raise? Some people might think it is the only reason we would educate ourselves in the first place. The answer, however, is simply no. Education is the key to success, but the ultimate goal of education is to help individuals' life and contribute to society once they are older. Education eradicates poverty and hunger, giving people a chance at better lives. One of the biggest reasons parents strives to make their kids attend school as long as possible. It is also why nations work toward promoting more accessible access to education for both children and adults.<br><br>

We live in a world where the requirements of different occupations in the job market are changing over decades. Education edifies minds to use their critical and analytical thinking,  helps in developing; leadership skills, and obtains valuable skills that allow them to acquire jobs.  A country with a greater literacy rate is more likely to have stable economic development. They are more likely to solve the issues within their communities with quick and creative solutions. There may not be any poverty or people who will suffer from starvation. There will be peace and justice for those who seek it. Education is what teaches us not to discriminate between different races, religions, and human rights. <br><br>

Knowledge and skills are valued over power and money. If you have adequate knowledge, you can experience things the world might offer. Skills only achievable through proper education can be your asset to success. Educating yourself on current global affairs can help you devise innovative ideas to solve global issues within your communities.<br><br>

Education is the key to solving social problems and developing our personalities. It is the key to changing the world and making it a better place to live. </p>

      <h5>Real Stories | by: Sarah Kritikos, September 2, 2022</h5>

      <p>This past year, reading has become a rising trend amongst teens and young adults. Social media (such as: Tik Tok, Instagram, Wattpad, etc.) has once again influenced viewers into a trend. This time, however, it wasn't something crazy or dangerous (unless you think being locked away in your room immersed in the world of books is). 
      </p>
      <p>BokTok (like TikTok but for books) is a wonderful community of readers, writers, and people who want to get into reading or just stumbled across the page and decided to stay. Although the name originated on TikTok, it happened to make its way across other places such as Instagram, Twitter, and even certain news channels as #BokTok, expanding its following.</p>
      <p>BokTok has been one of the most positive things to have happened on social media in a long time. This continuously growing community has provided authors with the recognition they deserve for their books and literary hopefuls for their newly found passions in writing and reading. But there are still a few downsides, like going into Barnes and Nobles to get a book you saw earlier on TikTok but it being sold out by the time you got there, spending your life's savings on books, or getting into heated arguments about favorite authors and genres. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing with the positives, people always said that reading helps with improving overall intelligence and many of the people who joined the BokTok community have said how their reading and writing skills improved due to the increased amount that they read. Some have even reported how their parents have to drag them away from their book to get some fresh air. But most of all, this community has brought many people together from all over the world to share a common interest, literature.

      <h2>Houellebecq's <i>Submission</i> </h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Nickolas Vaccaro, September 2, 2022</h5>
      <div >

        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782830830053621800/1025908832251166830/IMG_6611.jpg"  alt="" style="width: 100%;" >
      </div>

      <p>It is a great power of literature to reflect contemporary society and politics. Through literature, as through art, the writer records what they see in a mirror held obliquely to the world. Reflecting and dreaming, literature can imagine the best and worst of humanity to lead it to better days. </p>
      <p>Michel Houellebecq in <i>Submission</i> has created a dissonance of social division, personal disillusionment, political upheaval, all with the bitter taste of disquiet. The novel, translated from the French in 2015, takes place in 2022 and centers on the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood Party, an Islamist political movement that supports and later establishes religious government and social patriarchy on a France torn by ethnic conflict and popular apathy and exclusive for self-interest. The ascent of the Muslim Brotherhood (that with the Socialist Party formed the National Front) is told from the perspective of a morally resigned literature scholar, Francois, who recounts political wrangling, hypocrisy, and violence in off-hand digressions from monologues on the Decadent author Huysmans (the author he studies), lurid obscenities, mockery of colleagues' mediocrity, tirades against gender equality, and monologues on the virtues of patriarchy.</p>
      <p>The reprehensibility of Francois's beliefs exists within the reprehensibility of ethnic conflict and the intolerance and ignorance from which it arises. Yet this reprehensibility is not answered, it is not qualified by even a hinted desire for justice or struggle for change in French society. Neither the speaker and intelligentsia, nor the government and public, visibly express beliefs against forced religious conversion, abridgment of education, or restriction of protest and personal liberty; nor do they believe misogyny, antisemitism, or xenophobia to be immoral and unjust. This lack of a champion for morality contributes to an unforgiving sense of doom that is helpless and that permeates the novel; this is caused by and continues the characters' moral indifference. In the absence of ethical, human awareness the reader is led to surrender their own conceptions of justice and equality and moral right, perceiving what humanity is capable of once it resigns to avarice, hostility, and prejudice. </p>
      <p>Francois remarks—after days spent in a chapel built upon the blood-stained end of a medieval French-Arab war—"I knew I was close to suicide, not out of despair or even any special sadness, simply from the degradation of 'the set of functions that resist death'" (Houllebecq, 168). </p>
      <p>Houellebecq portrays a people standing at a precipice, glazed with detachment. They spend the remains of life and human vigor on prejudice and bitter hostility. A thunderstorm grows on the French horizon, and it is unclear from where it came or where it will pour its rage.</p>
      <p><i>Submission</i> indulges what racism, ethnocentrism, and nationalism imagine society to be and to become, to convey the error and absurdity of these beliefs and the depravity to which we will come if they <i>are</i> indulged.</p>
      <p>The novel is a subtle satire, more illustration than explanation, in which Houellebecq walks a fine line between parodying and imitating, denouncing and agreeing; and in which he takes a mirror to what is past and what is to come—with the intention of inspiring change.</p>

      <h2>Nancy Drew: Sleuthing Teen Hero</h2>

      </div>
      <p>Carolyn Keene is an American writer mainly known for her splendid books of mystery and suspense. One of her most commendable books as a writer to date is Nancy Drew.</p>
      <p>The plot revolves around Nancy Drew, a teen sleuthing hero, who is raised by her father, Carson Drew- River Heights's most renowned criminal lawyer, after the death of her mother Katherine Drew when Nancy was three years old. The housekeeper, Hannah Gruen, is an old woman who served the Drews for a long time and helped Carson to raise Nancy. Since childhood, Nancy was fond of solving the hardest of mysteries, accompanied by two supportive best friends and cousins, Bess Marvin and George Fayne. Sometimes Nancy's passion for solving unsolved cases gets her into life-threatening situations and extreme troubles. Luckily Nancy has her sweetheart, Ned Nickerson looks after her, encouraging and sticking with her through thick and thin to help her move forward and fulfill her passions. Nancy Drew is now named the River Height's hero, as she has solved cases that no other detective or expert could, helping numerous people out of difficult situations. But even she is not without troubles of her own. </p>
      <p>Reading a book exercises our brain, and improves memory, focus, empathy, and communication skills, not to mention the vast amount of knowledge that literature gives. The hormone oxytocin is released in our body, and stress and anxiety levels decrease. Hence, mental health is improved.
        Nancy Drew appeals to the existence and emotions of the young adult. The "Nancy Drew" stories are what readers seek in mystery books- and still, they have something of romance, drama, and adventure. </p>
        <p>The reader discovers the value of friendship, the necessity, and the power of kindness and empathy in Nancy Drew, as profound as it is exhilarating. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 12px;">Remains of a Ukrainian drama theatre that was sheltering hundreds of people when it was bombed</p>
      </div>

      <p>The ongoing war in Ukraine ripples throughout the globe, with the dire consequences of war, high fuel costs, product shortages, and an impeding flow of goods. While all of these industries came to a halt, cultural institutions were left unprotected, endangering Ukraine's ancient heritage. Seeking to protect Ukrainian culture from erasure, revision, and appropriation, intellectuals and conservators have teamed up to form a preservation task force, the Center to Rescue Cultural Heritage. </p>
      <p>Members of the committee aim to conserve the history, tradition, and art of the Ukrainians, to protect the right of a people to exist, to determine their futures, and to define who they are. Many Ukrainian institutions, churches, castles, museums, and libraries lacked adequate materials and guidance to conserve art. In conjunction with a wide range of Polish museums, packages arrived via train from Warsaw containing boxes and styrofoam. Many other nations stepped in to help, including Norway, Denmark, and Germany. After receiving a mass influx of materials, it became evident that this type of humanitarian aid took more of a cultural theme. </p>
      <p>As Ukrainian soldiers continue to fight, heritage specialists serve in a similar battle, to save Ukraine's various monuments and historical sites. Over the war, many heritage sites have been subjected to shelling and targeted destruction. Looting has occurred in many cities, and regional museums have been burnt to the ground. For instance, Babyn Yar, a ravine located in the capital of Kyiv where thousands of Jews were executed at the hands of the Nazis, was bombed. Despite the horrific tragedies that occurred at this site, it had become symbolic of an era. Also, the Donetsk Regional Drama Theater, which was being used at the time for civilian shelter, also fell to the hands of Russian forces. Many cities across Ukraine, especially Mariupol and Kyiv, have been subjected to these attacks with residents living in fear. While this war includes both human and cultural losses, both reflect apparent and tangible devastation. </p>

      </div></h5>
      <p >The elopement of Romeo and Juliet, as rendered in <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i>.<br>
      <p>The consequence of William Shakespeare's works transcends only the literary and the dramatic, and epitomizes the human existence in its most elementary facets, thus remaining salient to modernity. Yet if Shakespeare continues to affect literature, his writing persistently daunts the early reader, enkindling a sentiment that taints the will to interact with preceding writings, cultures, and peoples.</p>
      <p style="text-align: none;"><i>Tales from Shakespeare</i> thus illuminates the Shakespearean drama with an accessibility that one young requires to comprehend the overarching narratives, lessons on morality, and representations that vitalize the poetry and make it essential as an introduction to and study of the English-speaking peoples, their traditions in art, philosophy, and history - all of which Shakespeare sews in timeless creations.</p>
      <p>     Coupling the written word are vivid drawings that define the narrative in a sensory appeal that captivate most the young, and so excite an artistic, literary, and cultural appreciation. Charles and Mary Lamb, writing their <i>Tales</i> in 1807, have created a work that is of great literary merit, motivating novel generations of readers, of writers, of art. </p>

      <p>      During an age in which division is sooner sown than alleviated, in which truth and history have become perplexed by falsity and opportunistic revisionism, retrospection not only prevents the repetition of tragedy, diseasing posterity with the transgression of its predecessors, but also motivates strife for untainted truth, which, remaining perverted, a shadow of reality, is then from its seeker buried in the rubble of cataclysms caused by the peoples now mourning them. </p>
      <p>   Tragedy and its denial, lasting all eras and facets of humanity, necessitates a defense of its havoc—that it devastates to find an existence without devastation.</p>
      <p> Witnessing the events up to January 6, 2021, and reflecting upon them, it is a  mistake to name them <i>unprecedented</i> or <i>anomalous</i>, as their symptoms, pervading human history and finding crescendoes from Qing Shi Huang's eradication of books in the third century BCE to Poland's dismissal of culpability for the Holocaust in the twenty-first century AD, compel the perception that affliction, transgression, and evil are often banal. And it is when one names them <i>mundane, ordinary</i>, when one ceases to think critically, read widely, conserve evenhandedly, act empathetically, and seek the truth passionately, that calamity is born anew.</p>

      <h2>On "A Christmas Carol"</h2>

      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Nickolas Vaccaro, December 29, 2021</h5>

      <p>However a product of a society with varying, and at times opposed, ethical, cultural, and artistic values <i>A Christmas Carol</i> endures as a morally and linguistically critical work that embodies the western tradition of winter in a writing, available to youth, that instructs the individual the significance of kindness and the necessity of charity. </p>
      <p>Concise yet expansive in characterization, the text introduces Ebenezer Scrooge, an aged, halt employer, whose sister, Fran, having perished, catalyzed in her death a sickly greed and a decided contempt for festivity. Scrooge, exploiting the inability of the poor to suffice in payment, averts all forgiveness, namely to Bob Cratchit, his clerk, thus endangering the health of Tiny Tim, who is ordained to die if Scrooge remains relentless, as is foretold to Ebenezer by the Ghost of Christmas Present. </p>
      <p>Favoring the mercy and humanity that the Christmastide compels, <i>A Christmas Carol</i> upholds the natural equality of peoples, notwithstanding their socio-economy, and the ever needed virtue of empathy; the still-pervading materialism that couples Christmas is discounted by Charles Dickens in accessible and characteristically transcending and magical prose. </p>

      <p>Reading novels, short stories or other forms of literature can be a great way to develop a strong base for both spoken and written English. Reading, not only increases your proficiency level, but also productively engages you and eventually develops into an interesting hobby. It can make learning fun.</p>
      <p>Keeping all this in mind, we have created a list of books that can help you master the language. However,  keep in mind to not be too hard on yourself! There may be times when you may not get certain meanings of words or what the author is saying. Regardless, do not lose hope. One cannot master English in a short span, so persevere, look up meanings when you're lost, ask for help when you need it and enjoy the journey!</p>
      <p>These books are in the order of various levels of proficiency, so feel free to browse and pick what suits you well!</p>

      <div>
        <div>1. Matilda- Beginner</div>
        <p>Matilda is a great book to start with. Roald Dahl's writing is simple, yet interesting. Any of his books are written in basic English and help develop the skill of imagining scenes as they read, especially in younger readers. Moreover, most of Roald Dahl's books also have an illustrated version that can further help in facilitating this process of mental imagery and visualization.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div>2. The Percy Jackson Series- Beginner</div>
        <p>The beauty about this series is that it isn't particularly difficult to read and it isn't boring either. A gripping plot, along with the simple use of English immediately catches the reader's attention. What's more is that the plot introduces readers to both Western and Greek culture, which can be quite an enlightening experience for those who wish to learn along the way. While readers may have to look up the meaning of certain words or phrases at times, the effort is definitely worth it- especially for those who love mythology and fiction.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div>3. Chicken Soup For The Soul- Intermediate</div>
        <p>The Chicken Soup Series is best for those who prefer short stories over full-length novels. Being a collection of several short stories, the original book is a crisp, sweet read with proficient use of English. The best part is that if you're looking at switching to longer novels/anthologies, you can always go ahead and read other versions of the series ( such as Chicken Soup For The Teenage soul, etc.)  to develop that habit of sticking with one book at a time.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div>4. The Book Thief- Advanced</div>
        <p>This book is perfect for those readers who wish to expand their use of the language in a more creative way. The Book Thief employs several literary devices and abstract ideas that encourage advanced readers- especially those who are pretty familiar with English- to read between the lines and analyze nuanced concepts. It is also a great way to educate yourself more about the history of the holocaust and its impacts.</p>
      </div>

      <p>As growing readers, we encourage you to go beyond this list, explore and find out what you like, what you don't and expand all your skills. Reading is a great way to stimulate your imagination, creativity, and analytical skills- so make the most of it and enjoy the process. Happy Reading!</p>

      <p>Percy Jackson was a big part of my childhood, as I'm sure it was for many other children who grew up reading Rick Riordan's stories. I spent many summers hunched over the children's section of my local library, entranced by the rich world that Rick Riordan created for the Percy Jackson universe, seamlessly weaving ancient mythology into a modern-day setting. Rick Riordan's books have been so successful that the name Percy Jackson is universally recognized. Similar to the names Harry Potter and Katniss Everdeen, Percy Jackson is recognized by children around the world.</p>
      <p>Just last year, my cousin visited me from China for the first time since we were four. My Chinese is as broken as her English, and we hadn't talked in many years. However, after seeing a Percy Jackson book in my house, she was able to share with me her love for the series, despite our language barriers. She told me how she even had an English version of the book at her home, and how she read it for her English class in China. Through Percy Jackson, we were able to reconnect, and I realized the impact Percy Jackson and other influential children's books have on English Second Language learners. </p>
      <p>Percy Jackson might not be a traditional book that comes to mind when it comes to second language learning, but I believe it is a good resource for second language learners. Unlike books like Harry Potter or The Hunger Games, Percy Jackson is set in a modern setting, without magical schools or dystopian societies. It may be a fantasy series, but it has realistic aspects of American life. Rick Riordan's characters are incredibly diverse, including characters from numerous cultural backgrounds and orientations. The Percy Jackson series helps language learners read about the world of today, and look up to characters who are similar to themselves. His characters are neurodiverse and ethnically diverse. Percy Jackson has Dyslexia, which is incorporated into his way of viewing the world. One of Riordan's new series, Magnus Chase, it features a genderfluid character named Alex Fierro, who is one of the main characters of the series. Rick Riordan's books showcase an amazing variety of diversity and inclusion, which I think is an important thing to read about when learning English. Not only can ESL children learn new words and phrases from the series, but they can relate to the characters that are portrayed. </p>
      <p>Rick Riordan has an ability to incorporate humor into his writing, which I find very enjoyable. I think Percy Jackson is a good series to read for ESL learners because it includes a light, humorous tone of writing. Oftentimes, Riordan makes creative jokes, chapter titles, and other fun additions to the story writing that make the series fun to read. Other classic stories in English such as Lord of the Rings contain rich, descriptive language that may often be overwhelming to second language learners. However, Riordan writes in a way that is both descriptive, and fun to read. He sprinkles in jokes and light-hearted humor and delivers it in a way that is relatable and appealing to the younger generation. This makes the series more enjoyable to a lot of children because he makes reading entertaining. </p>
      <p>I've personally enjoyed Percy Jackson a lot in my childhood, and it was one of my favorite series when I was younger. I remember being stunned by the diversity and inclusion Riordan had in his series, something I didn't see much in other books at the time. Reading Riordan's books was always enjoyable for me, and I loved his creative jokes and titles he added to the series. I think the Percy Jackson series is a great series for anyone to start reading, and reading Percy Jackson can help bridge the gap between languages and help ESL students. </p>

      <h2>The Impact Of Harry Potter</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Frank Granda, February 27, 2021</h5>
      <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/287f8bee-30b1-4ec7-96da-2b5cac237af5/harry_potter.jpg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" class="fakeimg" style="float: left; height:300px;" >
      <p>On September 1, 1998, Scholastic published Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first US edition of the UK's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone which became the first book in the now-iconic Harry Potter series written by J.K Rowling. Harry Potter has since evolved into the multimedia empire seen today. The spread of Harry Potter can be seen throughout generations since the kids who first started reading the series back in the 90s still now enjoying the present day which shows the popularity of the series to this day. The reason why it seems to be very successful is because of its scope in the epic fantasy, the intimacy of its characters, and the scope of the setting which provides a bigger world outside of the books which provide a form of escapism for the reader. Another factor that explains the popularity of the series is the countless attempts to ban the series from conservative groups due to the perceived usage of witchcraft and sorcery. The series also sent shockwaves throughout children's literature by creating the modern-day boom of young adult literature due to the sheer scale and popularity of the series. It is because of Harry Potter that works such as The Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and other books in the young adult genre have been as successful as they are known for.</p>
      <p>    A significant contribution of Harry Potter is how it introduced new words such as "muggle" and the concept of "Quidditch" into the English language. "Quidditch" is now an official sport with a "Quidditch" World Cup played once every two years. The reason why it can spark interest in helping kids all over the globe learn English is because it tells an interesting plot, characters, and setting that can hook in new readers which can inspire them to further look into the English language as a whole. It is because of these reasons that Harry Potter has become the now iconic, worldwide juggernaut that it has become today and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.</p>

      <h2>A Testament to Education</h2>
      <h5>Real Stories | by: Judy Saafein, January 14, 2021</h5>

      <p>In rural areas, it's hard to get a proper education. For the people who can, they have to travel miles to reach their school, only to receive an unsatisfactory education. Bridge to Literacy has partnered up with Spring Sprouts to help improve education for people from poverty-stricken areas, focusing on rural Honduras and China. Our program is focused on giving an individualized curriculum for each student based on their skill level. </p>
      <p>It starts by coordinating a meeting with the student and appointed teacher. There the teacher asks them questions to assess their skill levels while trying to bond with the student. We don't want students to have a strict teacher-student relationship, but a nice experience that encourages learning. </p>
      <p>After receiving information about the student's skill levels, a team of our volunteers works on creating specific lesson plans using material from online workbooks and "official" videos (fact-checked). The teacher makes final edits before presenting the lesson to their student the following week. </p>
      <p>To show you an example of the process, I'm going to talk about a personal friend of mine that I help in English. For some background information, I'm a writer and teacher here. Anyway, this young boy, my cousin, lives in Gaza, and I was telling him about Bridge to Literacy when he agreed to join. Due to the pandemic, schools were shut down in his area, so he thought learning a second language can help kill time. So I gave his information to the admin and began talking to him in English to assess his skills-which turned out to be really good. Just to be sure, I began by giving him basic lessons, which he quickly zoomed by- so now I create customized lessons similar to his level. </p>
      <p>Before concluding, I just wanted to add that this experience is just as rewarding to the contributors as it is to the students. I speak for all of us when I say that being the reason these kids are excelling against the odds, is exhilarating. The pride you feel as a teacher when your student succeeds, or as a writer when someone uses your line, or as a publicist getting their ads noticed- it's awesome. And we're ecstatic to be a part of it.</p>

      <h2>Fleur Jaeggy's The Water Statues</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Nickolas Vaccaro, July 16, 2022 </h5>
      <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/287f8bee-30b1-4ec7-96da-2b5cac237af5/the%20water%20statues.jpeg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" style="height: 400px; float:left;" class="fakeimg">
      <p>Innovation resents tradition and security, and for literature to be innovative it must resent security of plot, even the reader's comfort; it must resent neatness and molds of style and structure and genre; it must unsettle us from expectation of what poetry, play, or prose must be. Yet literature that innovates must exist not solely for innovation, but for expression of that which cannot otherwise be conveyed or shown: humanity in the present cannot find expression in devotion to the past. </p>
      <p> <i>The Water Statues </i> (originally written in Italian) cannot be considered strictly prose, as the writing is given in brief scenes which seem more canto or dramatic act than chapter, and <i>Dramatis Personae </i>precedes the text; nor poetry or drama, as scenes of poetic absence are followed by prosaic exposition. Jaeggy is not strictly poet, playwright or novelist; she is both witness and explorer of the plot she imagines. The text centers on Beeklam, a youth estranged from society and retired to a coastal house, where, in the dewy basement (enwombed by waves), he dwells with the statues he collects, standing knee-deep in water. </p>
      <p>The author, with the reader, only glimpses at the plot, or imagines it from glimpses. Jaeggy retires, as Beeklam, between chapters into a dream in which she weaves the living and the dead, familiar and forgotten, flesh and stone into simple continuity; her gaze leaps from one existence to another, from Beeklam to Katrin to Lampe, and confuses the dead for the living and memory for reality. There is presence in distance, much like in poetry: the flooding water, the dead mother (after whom Beeklam names a statue), the image of a father, the presence of strangers, and other lights in other windows which Beeklam so intently observes. </p>
      <p><i>The Water Statues</i> does not seek to innovate, but does so from necessity; for to thread together the dead and alive, to sculpt the once dead into something living, to animate stone, the past is unable. Fleur Jaeggy sees another world, or finds it in ours, as Woolf and Milton and Homer before her. </p>

      <h2>The House on Mango Street: A Coming of Age</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Angelina Ochoa, August 9, 2022</h5>
      <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/287f8bee-30b1-4ec7-96da-2b5cac237af5/mangostrt.jpeg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" class="fakeimg" style="height: 400px; float: left;">
      <br>
      <p>Composed of lyrical vignettes, <i>The House on Mango Street</i> by Sandra Cisneros tells the story of a young Mexican-American girl named Esperanza. She embarks on a new journey of life when her family moves into a house on Mango Street. While it is not her ideal picture of a fresh start, she is determined that she will one day leave Mango Street and have independence.</p>
      <p>   However, during her time on Mango Street, Esperanza goes through many changes that align perfectly with what modern-day teenagers experience. She goes through the process of making friends, exploring relationships, and having her mindset grow through all that she witnesses. Throughout all this, she remains vulnerable in her writing as a way to not only document what is happening around her but as a way to escape the overwhelming changes she has to adapt to.</p>
      <p>  Cisneros' composition of the novel reflects a desire to reach out to teenagers who have just started a new phase of their lives in hopes of showing readers that the challenges they have faced are both valid and shared. Through the eyes of the narrator, Esperanza, Cisneros conveys a coming of age theme, in which Esperanza becomes aware of her growing responsibilities. A prime lesson described in this novel is that just like the narrator, one can gradually pave their own way to finding their authentic self-identity in society. </p><br><br>
