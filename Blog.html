      <h2>Shakespearean Paraphrase</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Nickolas Vaccaro, February 19, 2022</h5>

      <p >The elopement of Romeo and Juliet, as rendered in <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i>.</p>
      <p>The consequence of William Shakespeare's works transcends only the literary and the dramatic, and epitomizes the human existence in its most elementary facets, thus remaining salient to modernity. Yet if Shakespeare continues to affect literature, his writing persistently daunts the early reader, enkindling a sentiment that taints the will to interact with preceding writings, cultures, and peoples.</p>
      <p style="text-align: none;"><i>Tales from Shakespeare</i> thus illuminates the Shakespearean drama with an accessibility that one young requires to comprehend the overarching narratives, lessons on morality, and representations that vitalize the poetry and make it essential as an introduction to and study of the English-speaking peoples, their traditions in art, philosophy, and history - all of which Shakespeare sews in timeless creations.</p>
      <p>     Coupling the written word are vivid drawings that define the narrative in a sensory appeal that captivate most the young, and so excite an artistic, literary, and cultural appreciation. Charles and Mary Lamb, writing their <i>Tales</i> in 1807, have created a work that is of great literary merit, motivating novel generations of readers, of writers, of art. </p>

      <p>      During an age in which division is sooner sown than alleviated, in which truth and history have become perplexed by falsity and opportunistic revisionism, retrospection not only prevents the repetition of tragedy, diseasing posterity with the transgression of its predecessors, but also motivates strife for untainted truth, which, remaining perverted, a shadow of reality, is then from its seeker buried in the rubble of cataclysms caused by the peoples now mourning them. </p>
      <p>   Tragedy and its denial, lasting all eras and facets of humanity, necessitates a defense of its havocâ€”that it devastates to find an existence without devastation.</p>
      <p> Witnessing the events up to January 6, 2021, and reflecting upon them, it is a  mistake to name them <i>unprecedented</i> or <i>anomalous</i>, as their symptoms, pervading human history and finding crescendoes from Qing Shi Huang's eradication of books in the third century BCE to Poland's dismissal of culpability for the Holocaust in the twenty-first century AD, compel the perception that affliction, transgression, and evil are often banal. And it is when one names them <i>mundane, ordinary</i>, when one ceases to think critically, read widely, conserve evenhandedly, act empathetically, and seek the truth passionately, that calamity is born anew.</p>

      <h2>On "A Christmas Carol"</h2>

      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Nickolas Vaccaro, December 29, 2021</h5>

      <p>However a product of a society with varying, and at times opposed, ethical, cultural, and artistic values <i>A Christmas Carol</i> endures as a morally and linguistically critical work that embodies the western tradition of winter in a writing, available to youth, that instructs the individual the significance of kindness and the necessity of charity. </p>
      <p>Concise yet expansive in characterization, the text introduces Ebenezer Scrooge, an aged, halt employer, whose sister, Fran, having perished, catalyzed in her death a sickly greed and a decided contempt for festivity. Scrooge, exploiting the inability of the poor to suffice in payment, averts all forgiveness, namely to Bob Cratchit, his clerk, thus endangering the health of Tiny Tim, who is ordained to die if Scrooge remains relentless, as is foretold to Ebenezer by the Ghost of Christmas Present. </p>
      <p>Favoring the mercy and humanity that the Christmastide compels, <i>A Christmas Carol</i> upholds the natural equality of peoples, notwithstanding their socio-economy, and the ever needed virtue of empathy; the still-pervading materialism that couples Christmas is discounted by Charles Dickens in accessible and characteristically transcending and magical prose. </p>

      <h2>Books that can help you master English</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Prakriti Panwar, May 5, 2021</h5>
      <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/stock/15412/:/cr=t:23.68%25,l:23.68%25,w:52.63%25,h:52.63%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" class="fakeimg" style="height: 300px; float:left;">
      <p>Reading novels, short stories or other forms of literature can be a great way to develop a strong base for both spoken and written English. Reading, not only increases your proficiency level, but also productively engages you and eventually develops into an interesting hobby. It can make learning fun.</p>
      <p>Keeping all this in mind, we have created a list of books that can help you master the language. However,  keep in mind to not be too hard on yourself! There may be times when you may not get certain meanings of words or what the author is saying. Regardless, do not lose hope. One cannot master English in a short span, so persevere, look up meanings when you're lost, ask for help when you need it and enjoy the journey!</p>
      <p>These books are in the order of various levels of proficiency, so feel free to browse and pick what suits you well!</p>

      <div>
        <div>1. Matilda- Beginner</div>
        <p>Matilda is a great book to start with. Roald Dahl's writing is simple, yet interesting. Any of his books are written in basic English and help develop the skill of imagining scenes as they read, especially in younger readers. Moreover, most of Roald Dahl's books also have an illustrated version that can further help in facilitating this process of mental imagery and visualization.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div>2. The Percy Jackson Series- Beginner</div>
        <p>The beauty about this series is that it isn't particularly difficult to read and it isn't boring either. A gripping plot, along with the simple use of English immediately catches the reader's attention. What's more is that the plot introduces readers to both Western and Greek culture, which can be quite an enlightening experience for those who wish to learn along the way. While readers may have to look up the meaning of certain words or phrases at times, the effort is definitely worth it- especially for those who love mythology and fiction.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div>3. Chicken Soup For The Soul- Intermediate</div>
        <p>The Chicken Soup Series is best for those who prefer short stories over full-length novels. Being a collection of several short stories, the original book is a crisp, sweet read with proficient use of English. The best part is that if you're looking at switching to longer novels/anthologies, you can always go ahead and read other versions of the series ( such as Chicken Soup For The Teenage soul, etc.)  to develop that habit of sticking with one book at a time.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div>4. The Book Thief- Advanced</div>
        <p>This book is perfect for those readers who wish to expand their use of the language in a more creative way. The Book Thief employs several literary devices and abstract ideas that encourage advanced readers- especially those who are pretty familiar with English- to read between the lines and analyze nuanced concepts. It is also a great way to educate yourself more about the history of the holocaust and its impacts.</p>
      </div>

      <p>As growing readers, we encourage you to go beyond this list, explore and find out what you like, what you don't and expand all your skills. Reading is a great way to stimulate your imagination, creativity, and analytical skills- so make the most of it and enjoy the process. Happy Reading!</p>

      <h2>Percy Jackson: Literary Masterpiece and ESL Resource</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Sheila Cholico, March 14, 2021</h5>
      <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/287f8bee-30b1-4ec7-96da-2b5cac237af5/DSPJ5-percy-jackson-and-the-olympians-5-1200_4.jpg/:/cr=t:13.53%25,l:8.06%25,w:73.53%25,h:73.53%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" class="fakeimg" style="  float: right;">
      <p>Percy Jackson was a big part of my childhood, as I'm sure it was for many other children who grew up reading Rick Riordan's stories. I spent many summers hunched over the children's section of my local library, entranced by the rich world that Rick Riordan created for the Percy Jackson universe, seamlessly weaving ancient mythology into a modern-day setting. Rick Riordan's books have been so successful that the name Percy Jackson is universally recognized. Similar to the names Harry Potter and Katniss Everdeen, Percy Jackson is recognized by children around the world.</p>
      <p>Just last year, my cousin visited me from China for the first time since we were four. My Chinese is as broken as her English, and we hadn't talked in many years. However, after seeing a Percy Jackson book in my house, she was able to share with me her love for the series, despite our language barriers. She told me how she even had an English version of the book at her home, and how she read it for her English class in China. Through Percy Jackson, we were able to reconnect, and I realized the impact Percy Jackson and other influential children's books have on English Second Language learners. </p>
      <p>Percy Jackson might not be a traditional book that comes to mind when it comes to second language learning, but I believe it is a good resource for second language learners. Unlike books like Harry Potter or The Hunger Games, Percy Jackson is set in a modern setting, without magical schools or dystopian societies. It may be a fantasy series, but it has realistic aspects of American life. Rick Riordan's characters are incredibly diverse, including characters from numerous cultural backgrounds and orientations. The Percy Jackson series helps language learners read about the world of today, and look up to characters who are similar to themselves. His characters are neurodiverse and ethnically diverse. Percy Jackson has Dyslexia, which is incorporated into his way of viewing the world. One of Riordan's new series, Magnus Chase, it features a genderfluid character named Alex Fierro, who is one of the main characters of the series. Rick Riordan's books showcase an amazing variety of diversity and inclusion, which I think is an important thing to read about when learning English. Not only can ESL children learn new words and phrases from the series, but they can relate to the characters that are portrayed. </p>
      <p>Rick Riordan has an ability to incorporate humor into his writing, which I find very enjoyable. I think Percy Jackson is a good series to read for ESL learners because it includes a light, humorous tone of writing. Oftentimes, Riordan makes creative jokes, chapter titles, and other fun additions to the story writing that make the series fun to read. Other classic stories in English such as Lord of the Rings contain rich, descriptive language that may often be overwhelming to second language learners. However, Riordan writes in a way that is both descriptive, and fun to read. He sprinkles in jokes and light-hearted humor and delivers it in a way that is relatable and appealing to the younger generation. This makes the series more enjoyable to a lot of children because he makes reading entertaining. </p>
      <p>I've personally enjoyed Percy Jackson a lot in my childhood, and it was one of my favorite series when I was younger. I remember being stunned by the diversity and inclusion Riordan had in his series, something I didn't see much in other books at the time. Reading Riordan's books was always enjoyable for me, and I loved his creative jokes and titles he added to the series. I think the Percy Jackson series is a great series for anyone to start reading, and reading Percy Jackson can help bridge the gap between languages and help ESL students. </p>

      <h2>The Impact Of Harry Potter</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Frank Granda, February 27, 2021</h5>
      <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/287f8bee-30b1-4ec7-96da-2b5cac237af5/harry_potter.jpg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" class="fakeimg" style="float: left; height:300px;" >
      <p>On September 1, 1998, Scholastic published Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first US edition of the UK's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone which became the first book in the now-iconic Harry Potter series written by J.K Rowling. Harry Potter has since evolved into the multimedia empire seen today. The spread of Harry Potter can be seen throughout generations since the kids who first started reading the series back in the 90s still now enjoying the present day which shows the popularity of the series to this day. The reason why it seems to be very successful is because of its scope in the epic fantasy, the intimacy of its characters, and the scope of the setting which provides a bigger world outside of the books which provide a form of escapism for the reader. Another factor that explains the popularity of the series is the countless attempts to ban the series from conservative groups due to the perceived usage of witchcraft and sorcery. The series also sent shockwaves throughout children's literature by creating the modern-day boom of young adult literature due to the sheer scale and popularity of the series. It is because of Harry Potter that works such as The Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and other books in the young adult genre have been as successful as they are known for.</p>
      <p>    A significant contribution of Harry Potter is how it introduced new words such as "muggle" and the concept of "Quidditch" into the English language. "Quidditch" is now an official sport with a "Quidditch" World Cup played once every two years. The reason why it can spark interest in helping kids all over the globe learn English is because it tells an interesting plot, characters, and setting that can hook in new readers which can inspire them to further look into the English language as a whole. It is because of these reasons that Harry Potter has become the now iconic, worldwide juggernaut that it has become today and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.</p>

      <h2>A Testament to Education</h2>
      <h5>Real Stories | by: Judy Saafein, January 14, 2021</h5>
      <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/287f8bee-30b1-4ec7-96da-2b5cac237af5/delete.jpg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" class="fakeimg" style="width: 100%;">
      <p>In rural areas, it's hard to get a proper education. For the people who can, they have to travel miles to reach their school, only to receive an unsatisfactory education. Bridge to Literacy has partnered up with Spring Sprouts to help improve education for people from poverty-stricken areas, focusing on rural Honduras and China. Our program is focused on giving an individualized curriculum for each student based on their skill level. </p>
      <p>It starts by coordinating a meeting with the student and appointed teacher. There the teacher asks them questions to assess their skill levels while trying to bond with the student. We don't want students to have a strict teacher-student relationship, but a nice experience that encourages learning. </p>
      <p>After receiving information about the student's skill levels, a team of our volunteers works on creating specific lesson plans using material from online workbooks and "official" videos (fact-checked). The teacher makes final edits before presenting the lesson to their student the following week. </p>
      <p>To show you an example of the process, I'm going to talk about a personal friend of mine that I help in English. For some background information, I'm a writer and teacher here. Anyway, this young boy, my cousin, lives in Gaza, and I was telling him about Bridge to Literacy when he agreed to join. Due to the pandemic, schools were shut down in his area, so he thought learning a second language can help kill time. So I gave his information to the admin and began talking to him in English to assess his skills-which turned out to be really good. Just to be sure, I began by giving him basic lessons, which he quickly zoomed by- so now I create customized lessons similar to his level. </p>
      <p>Before concluding, I just wanted to add that this experience is just as rewarding to the contributors as it is to the students. I speak for all of us when I say that being the reason these kids are excelling against the odds, is exhilarating. The pride you feel as a teacher when your student succeeds, or as a writer when someone uses your line, or as a publicist getting their ads noticed- it's awesome. And we're ecstatic to be a part of it.</p>

      <h2>Fleur Jaeggy's The Water Statues</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Nickolas Vaccaro, July 16, 2022 </h5>
      <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/287f8bee-30b1-4ec7-96da-2b5cac237af5/the%20water%20statues.jpeg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" style="height: 400px; float:left;" class="fakeimg">
      <p>Innovation resents tradition and security, and for literature to be innovative it must resent security of plot, even the reader's comfort; it must resent neatness and molds of style and structure and genre; it must unsettle us from expectation of what poetry, play, or prose must be. Yet literature that innovates must exist not solely for innovation, but for expression of that which cannot otherwise be conveyed or shown: humanity in the present cannot find expression in devotion to the past. </p>
      <p> <i>The Water Statues </i> (originally written in Italian) cannot be considered strictly prose, as the writing is given in brief scenes which seem more canto or dramatic act than chapter, and <i>Dramatis Personae </i>precedes the text; nor poetry or drama, as scenes of poetic absence are followed by prosaic exposition. Jaeggy is not strictly poet, playwright or novelist; she is both witness and explorer of the plot she imagines. The text centers on Beeklam, a youth estranged from society and retired to a coastal house, where, in the dewy basement (enwombed by waves), he dwells with the statues he collects, standing knee-deep in water. </p>
      <p>The author, with the reader, only glimpses at the plot, or imagines it from glimpses. Jaeggy retires, as Beeklam, between chapters into a dream in which she weaves the living and the dead, familiar and forgotten, flesh and stone into simple continuity; her gaze leaps from one existence to another, from Beeklam to Katrin to Lampe, and confuses the dead for the living and memory for reality. There is presence in distance, much like in poetry: the flooding water, the dead mother (after whom Beeklam names a statue), the image of a father, the presence of strangers, and other lights in other windows which Beeklam so intently observes. </p>
      <p><i>The Water Statues</i> does not seek to innovate, but does so from necessity; for to thread together the dead and alive, to sculpt the once dead into something living, to animate stone, the past is unable. Fleur Jaeggy sees another world, or finds it in ours, as Woolf and Milton and Homer before her. </p>

      <h2>The House on Mango Street: A Coming of Age</h2>
      <h5>Book Reviews | by: Angelina Ochoa, August 9, 2022</h5>
      <img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/287f8bee-30b1-4ec7-96da-2b5cac237af5/mangostrt.jpeg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" class="fakeimg" style="height: 400px; float: left;">
      <p>Composed of lyrical vignettes, <i>The House on Mango Street</i> by Sandra Cisneros tells the story of a young Mexican-American girl named Esperanza. She embarks on a new journey of life when her family moves into a house on Mango Street. While it is not her ideal picture of a fresh start, she is determined that she will one day leave Mango Street and have independence.</p>
      <p>   However, during her time on Mango Street, Esperanza goes through many changes that align perfectly with what modern-day teenagers experience. She goes through the process of making friends, exploring relationships, and having her mindset grow through all that she witnesses. Throughout all this, she remains vulnerable in her writing as a way to not only document what is happening around her but as a way to escape the overwhelming changes she has to adapt to.</p>
      <p>  Cisneros' composition of the novel reflects a desire to reach out to teenagers who have just started a new phase of their lives in hopes of showing readers that the challenges they have faced are both valid and shared. Through the eyes of the narrator, Esperanza, Cisneros conveys a coming of age theme, in which Esperanza becomes aware of her growing responsibilities. A prime lesson described in this novel is that just like the narrator, one can gradually pave their own way to finding their authentic self-identity in society. </p>
